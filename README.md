# yolo-vehicle-detection

This vehicle detection machine learning algorithm takes as input images or videos of vehicles and outputs the same images/videos and draws bounding boxes around them with a label and probability of that label being true. 

You can find the dataset used on kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alkanerturan/vehicledetection

The code is based off of alkan erturan's code which you can find here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alkanerturan/objectdetection-yolov8

My main goal was to see how running a jupyter notebook locally worked, and it turned out to be very educational. 

This is how the algo performed on a video I filmed: https://youtu.be/lBezAjISCm8

I hope you have fun tweaking and running this notebook on your computer.
